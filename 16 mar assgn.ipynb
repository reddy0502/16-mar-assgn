    "Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and has learned to fit the training data too closely, including the noise and random fluctuations in the data. This results in a model that performs very well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. The consequences of overfitting include poor generalization performance and a higher chance of making incorrect predictions on new data. Overfitting can be mitigated by using regularization techniques such as L1/L2 regularization, early stopping, or by increasing the amount of training data.\n",

    "Underfitting, on the other hand, occurs when a model is too simple and not able to capture the underlying patterns in the data. This results in a model that performs poorly on both the training data and new, unseen data. The consequences of underfitting include poor model performance and an inability to learn from the data. Underfitting can be mitigated by increasing the complexity of the model, increasing the number of training examples, or by adding more relevant features to the dataset."

    "Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique used to estimate the performance of a model on unseen data. It involves splitting the data into training and validation sets, fitting the model on the training set, and evaluating its performance on the validation set. This process is repeated multiple times with different subsets of the data to obtain a more robust estimate of the model's performance.\n",
